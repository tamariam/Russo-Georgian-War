                <p class="text-on-image">The 2008 Russo-Georgian War also named as August war was a war between Georgia,
                    on one side,
                    and
                    Russia and the

                    <h4>Background Tensions:</h4>
                    <p>The roots of the conflict can be traced back to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 when
                        Georgia declared
                        independence. The breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia sought independence from
                        Georgia, resulting in ongoing
                        tensions and sporadic outbreaks of violence.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="text-div">
                    <h4>Separatist Conflicts:</h4>
                    <p>Abkhazia and South Ossetia, both located within Georgia's internationally recognized borders,
                        declared independence in
                        the early 1990s. Russia supported the separatist movements in these regions, leading to a de
                        facto control of Abkhazia
                        and South Ossetia by Russian-backed separatist governments.</p>

                <div class="text-div">
                    <h4>NATO Aspirations:</h4>
                    <p>Georgia, under the leadership of President Mikheil Saakashvili, pursued closer ties with the
                        West, including aspirations
                        to join NATO. This move was met with resistance from Russia, which saw it as a threat to its
                        influence in the region.

                    <h4>Increasing Tensions:</h4>
                    <p>In the years leading up to the war, there were numerous incidents along the borders of Abkhazia
                        and South Ossetia,
                        including sporadic clashes between Georgian forces and separatist militias. Russia gradually
                        increased its military
                        presence in the breakaway regions, reinforcing its support for the separatists.</p>

                <div class="text-div">
                    <h4>Early August</h4>
                    <p>In August 2008, a series of incidents took place that escalated into a full-scale war. Georgian
                        forces launched an
                        offensive to regain control over South Ossetia, leading to a Russian military intervention.
                        Russian forces quickly
                        overwhelmed the Georgian military, and fighting spread to other parts of Georgia, including
                        Abkhazia.

                        Heavy fighting broke out in the South Ossetian capital, Tskhinvali, between Georgian forces
                        and separatist militias.
                        Russia began deploying military forces, including tanks and artillery, to support the

                        resolve the
                        conflict diplomatically.
                        On August 12, a ceasefire agreement was reached, putting an end to the active phase of the
                        war. Russian and Georgian
                        military forces halted their operations.</p>

            <p> It's important to note that the conflict did
                not end with the ceasefire agreement, and tensions remained high. Following
                the war, Russia recognized the independence of both South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and
                Russian forces maintained a military
                presence in the regions. The war had a significant impact on the geopolitical dynamics
                in the region and strained
                relations between Russia, Georgia, and the West.</p>
