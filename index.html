                    <h2>August War</h2>
                    <p>The 2008 Russo-Georgian War also named as August war was a war between Georgia, on one side, and
                        Russia and the
                        Russian-backed self-proclaimed
                        republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, on the other.</p>

                <h2>Pre War</h2>
                <h3>What caused the conflict?</h3>
                <div>
                    <h4>Background Tensions:</h4>
                    <p>The roots of the conflict can be traced back to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 when
                        Georgia declared
                        independence. The breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia sought independence from
                        Georgia, resulting in ongoing
                        tensions and sporadic outbreaks of violence.</p>

                    <h4>Separatist Conflicts:</h4>
                    <p>Abkhazia and South Ossetia, both located within Georgia's internationally recognized borders,
                        declared independence in
                        the early 1990s. Russia supported the separatist movements in these regions, leading to a de
                        facto control of Abkhazia
                        and South Ossetia by Russian-backed separatist governments.</p>

                    <h4>NATO Aspirations:</h4>
                    <p>Georgia, under the leadership of President Mikheil Saakashvili, pursued closer ties with the
                        West, including aspirations
                        to join NATO. This move was met with resistance from Russia, which saw it as a threat to its
                        influence in the region.
                    <p>

                    <h4>Increasing Tensions:</h4>
                    <p>In the years leading up to the war, there were numerous incidents along the borders of Abkhazia
                        and South Ossetia,
                        including sporadic clashes between Georgian forces and separatist militias. Russia gradually
                        increased its military
                        presence in the breakaway regions, reinforcing its support for the separatists.</p>

                    <h4>Early August</h4>
                    <p>In August 2008, a series of incidents took place that escalated into a full-scale war. Georgian
                        forces launched an
                        offensive to regain control over South Ossetia, leading to a Russian military intervention.
                        Russian forces quickly
                        overwhelmed the Georgian military, and fighting spread to other parts of Georgia, including
                        Abkhazia.

                        <h4>Day 1: August 7, 2008</h4>
                        <p>Georgian forces launched an offensive to regain control over the breakaway region of South
                            Ossetia.
                            Heavy fighting broke out in the South Ossetian capital, Tskhinvali, between Georgian forces
                            and separatist militias.
                            Russia began deploying military forces, including tanks and artillery, to support the
                            separatist forces in South
                            Ossetia.
                            Day 2: August 8, 2008</p>

                <div>
                    <h4>Day 2: August 8, 2008</h4>
                    <p>Russian airstrikes targeted Georgian military installations and infrastructure in various
                        parts of Georgia, including
                        the capital city, Tbilisi.
                        Russian forces continued to advance into South Ossetia, pushing back Georgian troops.

                <div>
                    <h4>Day 3: August 9, 2008</h4>
                    <p>Russian forces expanded the conflict beyond South Ossetia, launching attacks in other parts
                        of Georgia, including the
                        strategically important city of Gori.
                        The Georgian government declared a state of war and called for international support.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>Day 4: August 10, 2008
                    </h4>
                    <p>The conflict intensified as both sides engaged in heavy fighting across various fronts.
                        Russian forces entered the breakaway region of Abkhazia, further expanding their military
                        operations.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>Day 5: August 11-12, 2008</h4>
                    <p>The international community intensified its efforts to broker a ceasefire and resolve the
                        conflict diplomatically.
                        On August 12, a ceasefire agreement was reached, putting an end to the active phase of the
                        war. Russian and Georgian
                        military forces halted their operations.<span>It's important to note that the conflict did
                            not end with the ceasefire agreement, and tensions remained high. Following
                            the war, Russia recognized the independence of both South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and
                            Russian forces maintained a military
                            presence in the regions. The war had a significant impact on the geopolitical dynamics
                            in the region and strained
                            relations between Russia, Georgia, and the West.</span></p>
